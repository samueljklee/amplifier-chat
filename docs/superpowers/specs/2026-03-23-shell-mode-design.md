# Shell Mode for Amplifier Chat

**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Status:** Design

## Summary

Add direct shell command execution to Amplifier Chat via a `!` prefix. When the user types `!` as the first character, the input area transforms into a terminal-like mode. On send, the command bypasses the AI entirely and executes directly. The output renders using the existing `ToolCallCard` component as a synthetic bash tool call, making the command and its output part of the session transcript so the AI can reference them on subsequent turns.

## Motivation

Users frequently need to run quick shell commands (git status, ls, grep) without waiting for an AI round-trip. Currently they must switch to a separate terminal. This feature keeps them in the chat flow while clearly distinguishing shell interactions from AI conversations.

## Prior Art

Research across Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot CLI showed two existing patterns:

1. **AI-mediated execution** (Claude Code, Codex): The AI runs bash as tool calls. Output is part of the transcript. No user-initiated bypass.
2. **Separate terminal pane** (Cursor, Windsurf): Terminal is a different view with optional "add to context" bridges.

This design is novel: user-initiated shell execution rendered inline as synthetic tool calls, combining the contextual awareness of pattern 1 with the direct control of pattern 2.

## Design

### 1. Input Detection and Mode Switching

When the user types `!` as the first character in the textarea, the input area immediately transitions into "shell mode."

**Trigger:** `handleInput` detects the textarea value starts with `!` (and it's the first character, not mid-text).

**Revert:** When the user deletes back past the `!` (textarea value no longer starts with `!`), the input reverts to normal chat mode.

### 2. Input Area Visual Transformation ("Terminal Morph")

The transition is animated with CSS transitions (~200ms ease-out) to feel responsive but not jarring.

**Changes when shell mode activates:**

| Element | Normal Mode | Shell Mode |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Textarea border | `var(--border)`, blue on focus | `var(--accent-green)` with faint glow: `box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(34,197,94,0.15)` |
| Textarea font | System font (inherited) | Monospace: `'SF Mono', 'Cascadia Code', 'Fira Code', monospace` |
| Textarea content | User sees their text | The `!` prefix is hidden/consumed; a `$` prompt indicator appears to the left of the textarea (or as a pseudo-element/badge) |
| Send button label | "Send" | "Run" |
| Send button color | `var(--accent-blue)` | `var(--accent-green)` |
| Placeholder | "Message... (/ for commands)" | "command..." |

**CSS tokens (new):**

```css
:root {
  --shell-border: var(--accent-green);
  --shell-glow: rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.15);
  --shell-font: 'SF Mono', 'Cascadia Code', 'Fira Code', monospace;
}
```

**Light theme:** Same structure. The green border (`--accent-green` light variant: `#16a34a`) provides sufficient contrast on light backgrounds. Glow is reduced: `rgba(22, 163, 74, 0.1)`.

**Animation spec:**

- All properties transition with `200ms ease-out` on activation
- Revert transitions with `150ms ease-in` (slightly faster feels natural)
- Rapid toggling (type `!` then immediately delete): the shorter revert duration prevents visual stutter
- Properties animated: `border-color`, `box-shadow`, `font-family`, `background-color` (send button), `color` (send button)

### 3. Command Execution Flow

When the user hits Enter (or clicks "Run") in shell mode:

1. **Strip prefix:** Remove the `!` from the textarea value to get the raw command
2. **Clear input:** Reset textarea, revert to normal mode
3. **Send to backend:** POST to a new endpoint (or reuse `/command`) with the shell command
4. **Inject synthetic SSE events:** The backend emits:
   - `tool:pre` event with `{ name: 'bash', arguments: { command: '<the command>' } }`
   - Execute the command
   - `tool:post` event with the command output as the result
5. **UI renders via existing `ToolCallCard`:** The command appears as a collapsible tool call card, identical to AI-initiated bash calls

### 4. Output Rendering

The output uses the existing `ToolCallCard` component with one addition:

**User-initiated indicator:** The tool card header shows a small badge or label to distinguish user-initiated commands from AI-initiated ones.

| Origin | Tool Header Display |
|--------|-------------------|
| AI-initiated bash | `bash` + arg preview |
| User-initiated shell | `bash` + arg preview + `(user)` badge in `--text-muted` |

The `(user)` badge is a `<span>` styled with muted color and smaller font, positioned after the tool name.

**Existing rendering handles:**
- Collapsible expand/collapse (click header to toggle)
- `tool-result-text` for plain text output
- `tool-result-smart` for markdown-formatted output
- Error styling (`.tool-error-text`) for failed commands
- Max-height with scroll for long output (`max-height: 300px; overflow: auto`)

**Error states:** Non-zero exit codes render with the existing `tool-error-text` styling (red-tinted). The tool status icon shows error state.

### 5. Transcript Integration

The synthetic tool call events are injected into the session's event stream, making them part of the transcript. This means:

- The AI can reference previous shell output on subsequent turns ("I see you ran `git status` and there are unstaged changes...")
- Shell commands appear in session history when revisiting the session
- The `transcriptToChronoItems` function already handles `tool_call` type items, so no changes needed to the transcript parser

**Transcript structure of a shell command:**

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "name": "bash",
      "input": { "command": "ls -la" },
      "id": "user_shell_<uuid>",
      "user_initiated": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Followed by a tool result:

```json
{
  "role": "tool",
  "tool_use_id": "user_shell_<uuid>",
  "content": "<command output>"
}
```

The `user_initiated: true` flag allows the frontend to render the `(user)` badge and allows the backend to distinguish these from AI-initiated calls if needed.

### 6. Backend Endpoint

**Option A (preferred): New dedicated endpoint**

```
POST /api/sessions/{session_id}/shell
Body: { "command": "ls -la" }
Response: SSE stream with tool:pre, tool:post events
```

This keeps shell execution separate from the AI execution path (`/execute/stream`) while reusing the same SSE event format.

**Option B: Extend the existing `/command` endpoint**

Add a `shell` command type alongside existing slash commands. Less clean separation but fewer new routes.

Recommendation: Option A for clean architecture.

### 7. Security Considerations

- Shell commands execute with the same permissions as the Amplifier Chat backend process
- The same safety guardrails that apply to AI-initiated bash calls should apply here (blocked destructive commands, timeouts)
- Commands should have a default timeout (30 seconds) with the output streamed as it arrives
- No elevated privileges beyond what the user already has in their terminal

### 8. Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
- `!` prefix detection and input mode switching
- Animated input transformation
- Direct command execution (no AI round-trip)
- Output rendering via existing `ToolCallCard`
- Transcript integration
- Backend shell execution endpoint
- Light and dark theme support

**Not in scope (future work):**
- Command history / autocomplete in shell mode
- Persistent shell session (each command is independent)
- piping shell output to AI ("Share with AI" action)
- Custom shell selection (always uses default shell)
- Tab completion
